GatewayAPI.com documentation
============================

Our documentation is broken into a few parts based on protocol.
All new customers are encouraged to use the new :ref:`rest`. However we also
provide a few legacy APIs based on SOAP and HTTP POST/GET, which are still
maintained although deprecated.

If you are reading this online at https://gatewayapi.com/docs/ and require any
assistence, please use the live chat feature at the bottom right of your screen.
